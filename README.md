# IIT_Kanpur_Navigation_System

Objective: Develop an efficient navigation system that provides optimized routes across IIT Kanpur’s campus

Approach:
  1. Utilized Dijkstra’s Algorithm to create campus routing system, ensuring optimal paths for navigation
  2. Implemented the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to calculate precise distances between different locations
  3. Leveraged the Minimum Spanning Tree concept to enhance user experience by identifying nearby attractions
     
Outcome: Effectively employed the principles of C++, DSA, and OOPs to develop the optimized navigation system
